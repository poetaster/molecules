# Molecules ![Godot v3.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/godot-v3.2-%23478cbf)

A simple clone of Osmos, made with [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

This fork is a mobile version, intially aimed at SailfishOs. It should work anywhere with a touch interface.

I've also modified the sound, as noted below, to make the game smaller. 

The game in this version features score saving and modifies the dynamics of the molecules as you advance in clearing stages.
